CIS (Center for Internet Security)
----------------------------------

These collections of checks are referred to as "profiles". These profiles
encapsulate dozens of checks into one larger check list. We've created CIS
profiles for most major distributions and versions, so you should be ready to
go out of the box.

If you don't find a CIS profile for your distribution let us know on our issues
page.
