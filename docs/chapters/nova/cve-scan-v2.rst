CVE Scanning (vulners.com)
==========================

Another major component of the Nova auditing system is the on-demand CVE
scanning and reporting. This component automates the ingestion of security
advisory announcements, along with parsing, scanning and reporting. This
feature was inspired by FreeBSD's VuXML integration with `pkg audit`.

The required JSON files can be queried directly from the host, or you can use
the ``utils/cve_store.py`` to download data and serve it via the ``salt://``
fileserver.

There are two example Nova profiles bundled with the default installation.
``cve.scan-v2`` will query directly from the host for the CVE JSON data.
``cve.scan-v2-salt`` will serve the JSON data via the ``salt://`` fileserver.
