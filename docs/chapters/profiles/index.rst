Profiles
--------

The profiles are meant to be used as templates to build _your_ compliance
standard. Changes can be made to these templates to address internal
compensating controls, and known exceptions. These controls will be displayed
separately in the returned output.

It's also possible to write your own checks. If the existing profiles do not
include a check that you find important, add it. These profiles are meant to be
(near) human-readable, and very easy to add, update or remove. (As a best
practice you probably want to track changes in revision control, and peer
review for auditing purposes.)
